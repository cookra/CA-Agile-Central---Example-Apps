AttributeValues-DE24703Workaround
=================================================

This is a modified version of the [Attribute Values Example](https://help.rallydev.com/data-examples#Attribute%20Values) from AppSDK1 Docs that implements an ScheduleState query directly against the TypeDefinitions object instead of AppSDK placeholder convenience variables, as a workaround for DE24703.
